Step 1: 500 USD
- Extra page called: Owl Eye 3D Editor
- Open File by drag and drop or button and open file dialog (open .txt file, open .obj file)
- open file from DataList (extra Button beside "View" called "Edit") -> opens the pointcloud in the editor page and editor viewer
- Add a tool (find good position for this, maybe above maybe beside we have to discuss this when i can see it)
- colore: all points same colore or heightmap (like in the "old" viewer)
- Single point selection: selecte single points by clicking on them (selecte nearest point to clicked coordinates) (multiple selection must be possible by holding SHIFT)
- Polygon Selection (Polygon tool, pencil tool) to draw polygon, mark selected. Multi selection: Draw new polygon, hold SHIFT to add points
from new polygon to the selected one, press CTR to unmarke marked points
Left from STEP 1:
- press CTR to unmarke marked points

Step 2: 500 USD
- filter: add filter libs to filter pointcloud data -> can you do this? i need a "GridMinimumFilter" 
and a "Statistical Outliere Removal" Filter and a "pass through" filter, (Cubic Filter- Voxel Grid Filter)
- When filtering data or deleting points -> update the viewed pointcloud. but the steps must be revertable (ctr + z) !
- delauny 3D triangulate pointcloud
- selection of vertices like pointcloud selection must be possible. also same actions (delete, save, chane selection)
- triangulation view: surface and mesh
- Export pointclouds as .txt file, triangulation as .obj file

Step 3: 500 USD
- Actions with marked points: right click on selected points in viewer:1. change marked and unmarked points  2. delete points 3. save points in new pointcloud 
- When save pointclouds we need some kind of model browser (a list where the loaded pointclouds are stored (maybe a button with dropdown in toolbar). there we can save a pointcloud inside. and we can select it to edit it from here)
- rename models in modelbrowser 
- calculate volume between two files. selecte to pointcloud, calculate volume between these files.
